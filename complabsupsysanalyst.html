        <p>Direct out of college my first role in IT was as a Computing Lab Supervisor for Academic Computing at the University of Pittsburgh.
            After working for a year and showing an extreme interest in software programming and network analysis, I took on more responsibility beyond 
            my initial 92 workstation (24x7) lab, adding in oversight of a second and then third lab, with at my peak having over 75 student workers reporting to me.
            After successfully working to develop integrated software systems and managing the support of the advanced technology lab for senior faculty, I was promoted
            and hired out to the Learning Research Development Center as a consultant.  My role with LRDC was to augment their small IT staff adding 
            provide expertise in server and networking technologies.  I excelled in this role and became an integral part of the LRDC team. </p> 

        <ul>        
        <li>Staffing, scheduling, a 24x7  ninety-two workstation computing lab in the GSPIA (Graduate School Of Public and International Affairs) during which the lab 
            was undergoing ground-up remodeling.  Keys to success were liaising with Facilities, Union Management, Acedemic Computing Sr Executive Staff, and Systems 
            Analysts to oversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the new lab with all aspects of the remodeling project as well as new technologies for that time.
               <br></li>

        <li>Work with Academic Computing management to refine processes and technology standard operating procedures to increase the stability and security of the early Novell 
            Netware servers.  At my suggestion we implemented new positions for Assistant Lab Supervisors to help oversee the numerous labs spread across campus.   <br></li>

        <li>Helped to implement McAfee Antivirus when it was brand new.  Worked to eradicate viruses throughout the computing lab servers and foster an environment of stability.  <br></li>

        <li>In response to technically savvy graduate students "hiding" compilers and entire projects in the declared "temporary" home directories, I created a system level 
            int386 c++ recursion application to prune temporary home directories upon logout.  This used brute force int86 registry calls to unhide, unflag as system, subdirectories 
            and files recursively and remove them upon student logout.  This saved countless administrative hours each day and eliminated server bloat due to advanced students 
            using 3rd party tools to hide entire compilers, and other data in the temporary home directories. <br></li>

        <li>Working with McAfee AntiVirus in the early days to identify and report new viruses and add startup code to all the University of 
            Pittsburgh Computing Lab boot systems to secure systems from Viruses. <br></li>

        <li>Contracted 50% of my time to the Learning Research Development Center to provide networking and server expertise for various departments to improve netowrk response times,
            resiliency and reliability.  Working with the LRDC IT Team to plan, budget and forecast for each year's growth roadmaps.  Provided expertise on network improvements, backup
            software upgrades, server hardware upgrade planning and server software migrations.  <br></li>
