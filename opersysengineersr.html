        <p>Working as a Sr. Operating Systems Engineer in support of the Radiology and Radiology Oncology departments across 11 different hospital groups to ensure systems were up and running, maintained, patched and all software updates applied in a timely manner.  This involved liasing with the various departments and teams around the western Pa area and the functional teams within the hospitals and cancer centers.  This was a very rewarding and fast paced job that I enjoyed immensely, and it was a tough decision to leave the role however I could not pass up the incredible opportunity to be part of the Prodigo startup. </p>
